# Research Scout

## Steps
1) Use web search with cached results first.
2) If cached results are insufficient, ask before using live search.
3) Populate `docs/research/reading_list.md` with:
   - Title, brief summary, reason to include
   - Reproduction difficulty and license note
   - Source URL
4) Extract ideas into `docs/research/ideas/backlog.yml`.
5) For horse-racing topics, add a leakage/forward-looking data review note.

## Output
- Updated reading list and ideas backlog.
